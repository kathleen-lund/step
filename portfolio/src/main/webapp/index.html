      <p>Hi, my name is Katie, and I am a rising junior at Washington University in St. Louis. 
          I'm studying computer science and cognitive neuroscience. 
          I am originally from a suburb of Chicago called Libertyville, IL. 
          For fun, I like to play my cello or have family game nights!</p>
      <p>At school, I play cello in the symphony orchestra. I love to try
          new brunch places with my friends and get mozzarella sticks on Fridays
          at the cafeteria. I am also the president of Women in Computer Science on
          campus. I love being active in the engineering community at WashU!</p>
