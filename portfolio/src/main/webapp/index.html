      <p>Hi, my name is Katie, and I am a rising junior at Washington University in St. Louis. 
          I'm studying computer science and cognitive neuroscience. 
          I am originally from a suburb of Chicago called Libertyville, IL. 
          For fun, I like to play my cello or have family game nights!</p>
      <p>At school, I play cello in the symphony orchestra. I love to try
          new brunch places with my friends and get mozzarella sticks on Fridays
          at the cafeteria. I am also the president of Women in Computer Science on
          campus. I love being active in the engineering community at WashU!</p>
      <b>Some projects I've worked on...</b>
      <dl>
        <dt>Project COVID</dt>
        <dd>Worked as a Senior Mobile App Developer helping to develop a React Native app 
            to distribute unbiased information about COVID-19. Contributed mainly to the
            frontend. The app is currently in review on the iOS App Store.</dd>
        <dt>Invisibly</dt>
          <dd>Interned last summer for Square co-founder Jim McKelvey's startup. Worked
            on creative company side-projects, such as a "tinder for movie trailers" 
            Android mobile app and a driving game app to gamify earning money from
            ads. Used Kotlin, XML, Python, and C# in Unity.</dd>
        <dt>Hengenlab</dt>
        <dd>Began working as a student research assistant in the Hengenlab at WashU.
            This is a computational neuroscience lab. In-person lab work included
            building electrodes for implantation in mice, assisting with surgeries, 
            and discussing analysis with my MD/PhD mentor. Remote work included
            analyzing neural data using Python/JupyterLab.</dd>

      <p>I like to photograph exciting events I go to, such as photographing
          the Google booth at the Grace Hopper Celebration or posing by the 
          Google Cloud logo in the Chicago office. I love to take pictures of
          good times at WashU, such as when I did a hackathon presentation with
          a friend, a group photo of our orchestra, or a Women in Computer Science
          general body meeting.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">I also love to take pictures of my creations when cooking. Some of the
          ones featured here are peach cobbler and chicken lettuce wraps (just
          like the ones they make at P.F. Chang's!). Finally, I like to photograph
          my beagle-basset hound mix Irma, as well as take pictures with my family
          and during family vacations.</p>
