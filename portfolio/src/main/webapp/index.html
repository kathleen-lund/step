          Hi, my name is Katie, and I am a rising junior at Washington University in St. Louis. I'm studying computer
          science and cognitive neuroscience. I am originally from a suburb of Chicago called Libertyville, IL. For fun,
          I like to play my cello or have family game nights!
        </p>
        <p>
          At school, I play cello in the symphony orchestra. I love to try new brunch places with my friends and get
          mozzarella sticks on Fridays at the cafeteria. I am also the president of Women in Computer Science on campus.
          I love being active in the engineering community at WashU!
        </p>

            such as a "tinder for movie trailers" Android mobile app and a driving game app to gamify earning money from
            ads. Used Kotlin, XML, Python, and C# in Unity.

            Began working as a student research assistant in the Hengenlab at WashU. This is a computational
            neuroscience lab. In-person lab work included building electrodes for implantation in mice, assisting with
            surgeries, and discussing analysis with my MD/PhD mentor. Remote work included analyzing neural data using
            Python/JupyterLab.

          I like to photograph exciting events I go to, such as photographing the Google booth at the Grace Hopper
          Celebration or posing by the Google Cloud logo in the Chicago office. I love to take pictures of good times at
          WashU, such as when I did a hackathon presentation with a friend or a Women in Computer Science general body
          meeting.
        </p>

          I also love to take pictures of my creations when cooking. Some of the ones featured here are peach cobbler
          and chicken lettuce wraps (just like the ones they make at P.F. Chang's!). Finally, I like to photograph my
          beagle-basset hound mix Irma, as well as take pictures with my family and during family vacations.

              I have a secret love for bucket balls. Not only am I randomly good at tossing balls in incrementally
              spaced buckets, but I've had lots of opportunity to do so. Some of my fondest memories are tossing
              softballs back into the ball bucket from many yards away at the end of practice, to the delight of my
              teammates.

              My fingers are very double-jointed. I can bend them all downward at the first joint behind the nail, and
              my thumbs bend backwards in a hitchhiker's thumb position. This double-jointedness actually makes it a bit
              difficult to play the cello, as collapsing joints are a big no-no for your left hand.
